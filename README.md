You can use variables (`<param>` or `<param=default_value>` ) in snippets.

# Abstract

`pet` is written in Go, and therefore you can just grab the binary releases and drop it in your $PATH.

`pet` is a simple command-line snippet manager (inspired by [memo](https://github.com/mattn/memo)).
I always forget commands that I rarely use. Moreover, it is difficult to search them from shell history. There are many similar commands, but they are all different.

e.g. 
- `$ awk -F, 'NR <=2 {print $0}; NR >= 5 && NR <= 10 {print $0}' company.csv` (What I am looking for)
- `$ awk -F, '$0 !~ "DNS|Protocol" {print $0}' packet.csv`
- `$ awk -F, '{print $0} {if((NR-1) % 5 == 0) {print "----------"}}' test.csv`

In the above case, I search by `awk` from shell history, but many commands hit.

Even if I register an alias, I forget the name of alias (because I rarely use that command).

So I made it possible to register snippets with description and search them easily.

# Main features
`pet` has the following features.

- Register your command snippets easily.
- Use variables in snippets.
- Search snippets interactively.
- Run snippets directly.
- Edit snippets easily (config is just a TOML file).
- Sync snippets via Gist or GitLab Snippets automatically.

# Examples
Some examples are shown below.

## Register the previous command easily

### bash/zsh
By adding the following config to `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`, you can easily register the previous command.

```
$ cat .zshrc
function prev() {
  PREV=$(fc -lrn | head -n 1)
  sh -c "pet new `printf %q "$PREV"`"
}
```

## Select snippets at the current line (like C-r)

### bash
By adding the following config to `.bashrc`, you can search snippets and output on the shell.

```
$ cat .bashrc
function pet-select() {
  BUFFER=$(pet search --query "$READLINE_LINE")
  READLINE_LINE=$BUFFER
  READLINE_POINT=${#BUFFER}
}
bind -x '"\C-x\C-r": pet-select'
```

### zsh

```
$ cat .zshrc
function pet-select() {
  BUFFER=$(pet search --query "$LBUFFER")
  CURSOR=$#BUFFER
  zle redisplay
}
zle -N pet-select
stty -ixon
bindkey '^s' pet-select
```

### fish

# Features

## Edit snippets
The snippets are managed in the TOML file, so it's easy to edit.

## Sync snippets
You can share snippets via Gist.

------------------------------
```


# Configuration

Run `pet configure`

```
[General]
  snippetfile = "path/to/snippet" # specify snippet directory
  editor = "vim"                  # your favorite text editor
  column = 40                     # column size for list command
  selectcmd = "fzf"               # selector command for edit command (fzf or peco)
  backend = "gist"                # specify backend service to sync snippets (gist or gitlab, default: gist)

[Gist]
  file_name = "pet-snippet.toml"  # specify gist file name
  access_token = ""               # your access token
  gist_id = ""                    # Gist ID
  public = false                  # public or priate
  auto_sync = false               # sync automatically when editing snippets

[GitLab]
  file_name = "pet-snippet.toml"  # specify GitLab Snippets file name
  access_token = "XXXXXXXXXXXXX"  # your access token
  id = ""                         # GitLab Snippets ID
  visibility = "private"          # public or internal or private
  auto_sync = false               # sync automatically when editing snippets

```

## Selector option
Example1: Change layout (bottom up)

```
$ pet configure
[General]
...
  selectcmd = "fzf"
...
```

Example2: Enable colorized output
```
$ pet configure
[General]
...
  selectcmd = "fzf --ansi"
...
$ pet search --color
```

## Tag
You can use tags (delimiter: space).
```
$ pet new -t
Command> ping 8.8.8.8
Description> ping
Tag> network google
```

Or edit manually.
```
$ pet edit
[[snippets]]
  description = "ping"
  command = "ping 8.8.8.8"
  tag = ["network", "google"]
  output = ""
```

They are displayed with snippets.
```
$ pet search
[ping]: ping 8.8.8.8 #network #google
```

## Sync
### Gist
You must obtain access token.
Go https://github.com/settings/tokens/new and create access token (only need "gist" scope).
Set that to `access_token` in `[Gist]`.

After setting, you can upload snippets to Gist.  
If `gist_id` is not set, new gist will be created.
```
$ pet sync
Gist ID: 1cedddf4e06d1170bf0c5612fb31a758
Upload success
```

Set `Gist ID` to `gist_id` in `[Gist]`.
`pet sync` compares the local file and gist with the update date and automatically download or upload.

If the local file is older than gist, `pet sync` download snippets.
```
$ pet sync
Download success
```

If gist is older than the local file, `pet sync` upload snippets.
```
$ pet sync
Upload success
```

*Note: `-u` option is deprecated*

### GitLab Snippets
You must obtain access token.
Go https://gitlab.com/profile/personal_access_tokens and create access token.
Set that to `access_token` in `[GitLab]`.

After setting, you can upload snippets to GitLab Snippets.
If `id` is not set, new snippet will be created.
```
$ pet sync
GitLab Snippet ID: 12345678
Upload success
```

Set `GitLab Snippet ID` to `id` in `[GitLab]`.
`pet sync` compares the local file and gitlab with the update date and automatically download or upload.

If the local file is older than gitlab, `pet sync` download snippets.
```
$ pet sync
Download success
```

If gitlab is older than the local file, `pet sync` upload snippets.
```
$ pet sync
Upload success
```

## Auto Sync
You can sync snippets automatically.
Set `true` to `auto_sync` in `[Gist]` or `[GitLab]`.
Then, your snippets sync automatically when `pet new` or `pet edit`.

```
$ pet edit
Getting Gist...
Updating Gist...
Upload success
```

# Installation
You need to install selector command ([fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) or [peco](https://github.com/peco/peco)).  
`homebrew` install `fzf` automatically.

```
$ brew install knqyf263/pet/pet
```

If you receive an error (`Error: knqyf263/pet/pet 64 already installed`) during `brew upgrade`, try the following command

```
